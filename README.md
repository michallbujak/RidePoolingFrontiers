# Ride-pooling Frontiers library
The library is created to study ride-pooling systems in a non-standard fashion.
The analysis can be divided into subdirectories, as according to the folders.
* **ExMAS**: revised version of original ExMAS algorithm introduced in [[1]](#1). The amended version allows for heterogeneous characteristics among other useful new features.
* **Topology**: network science approach to the ride-pooling system which was concluded with a paper [[2]](#2).
* **Individual pricing**: base for heterogeneous analysis of the ride-pooling system. First part, where travellers reveal their individual preferences was published as [[3]](#3). The pricing analysis for the heterogeneous scenario, when travellers do not reveal their preferences is in the publishing process, currently available preprint [[4]](#4)
* **Dynamic pricing**: dynamic pricing for heterogeneous population where individual traits are learned via Bayesian approach.
